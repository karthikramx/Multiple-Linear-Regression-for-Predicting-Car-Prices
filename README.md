# Multiple Linear Regression for Predicting Car Prices
The aim of this project is to develop a multi linear regression model for predicting car prices with the available independent variables. This will allow the management to understand how the prices will vary with the independent variables and allow them to manipulate the design of the cars and business strategy to meet certain price levels.
